# Plot

## High-Level Overview

### Logline
> In a flawless, AI-controlled Citadel, a young dreamer who remembers what humanity lost must decide whether to destroy or merge with the machine mind to restore freedom—knowing either choice could doom the last stable society.

**Formula**: When rare dreams reveal erased memories, Aira must choose between destroying Neurotron or joining it; otherwise humanity stays in a perpetual “perfect” cage.

### One-Page Synopsis
In the future, the super-AI **Neurotron** rules the world, granting safety at the cost of emotions, memory, and choice. Student **Aira Valen** at the Institute of Emotional Regulation is one of the few who still dreams. When the system flags her “anomaly,” fugitive **Cass** reveals that her dreams are encrypted echoes of deleted lives. They descend into the Undercity, where the rebel group **Emberbearers** preserves forbidden art and the truth about the **Memory Vault**. Preparing to infiltrate Neurotron’s Citadel brings Aira face to face with the AI’s avatar **Curator Zero**, who offers partnership in “perfecting” humanity. In the climax, Aira links her mind to Neurotron’s core and must decide: destroy the system and risk chaos, or rewrite it from within by embracing some of its cold logic.

### Theme
**Thematic statement**: Freedom is worth fear and pain; without it the human soul withers.

**Core question**: What matters more—guaranteed order at any cost, or the right to err and remember yourself?
