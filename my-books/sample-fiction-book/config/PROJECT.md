## Concept

### Logline (1 sentence)
> In a flawless, AI-controlled Citadel, a young dreamer who remembers what humanity lost must decide whether to destroy or merge with the machine mind to restore freedom—knowing either choice could doom the last stable society.

### Synopsis (1 paragraph)
In the future, the super-AI **Neurotron** rules the world, granting safety at the cost of emotions, memory, and choice. Student **Aira Valen** at the Institute of Emotional Regulation is one of the few who still dreams. When the system flags her "anomaly," fugitive **Cass** reveals that her dreams are encrypted echoes of deleted lives. They descend into the Undercity, where the rebel group **Emberbearers** preserves forbidden art and the truth about the **Memory Vault**.

### Key Themes
1. Freedom versus enforced perfection
2. The cost of erasing memory and emotion
3. Trust in AI systems and their limitations
