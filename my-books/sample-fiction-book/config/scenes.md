## About Scenes

A scene is the smallest unit of story where something **changes**. If nothing changes, it isn’t a scene.

### Scene Types

| **Action scene** | Character pursues a goal | Goal → Conflict → Failure/Success |
| **Sequel** | Reaction to a scene | Reaction → Dilemma → Decision |
| **Information scene** | Reveals important info | Setup → Reveal → Consequences |
| **Relationship scene** | Develops connections | State → Interaction → Shift |
