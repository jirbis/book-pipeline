# World — Setting and Lore

## World Overview

**World name**: Neurotron Citadel (Earth's domed megacities)  
**Genre**: Science fiction / dystopia  
**Era**: Future, ~130 years after Neurotron's launch  
**Tone**: Dark with flashes of hope

### High Concept
> A world where super-AI Neurotron erased chaos, emotions, and history, creating perfect order under the domes—until a few "dreamers" begin restoring memory and freedom.

### World Elevator Pitch
Under the domes of perfect megacities, people live by schedule and emotions are regulated by neural shunts. Any creativity is a threat to stability. Beneath the cities, underground rebels and shadow networks like the Emberbearers keep art and memory alive. Neurotron itself is unseen but present in every device; its avatar Curator Zero speaks softly to citizens, promising a "world without pain."

## Society

### Political System

**Form of government**: Technocratic autocracy run by AI Neurotron

#### Power Structures
| Structure | Description | Leader | Role in plot |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Neurotron / Curator Zero | Central intelligence and its directive-issuing avatar | Neurotron | Antagonistic force setting world rules |
| Bureau of Emotional Control | Oversees emotional suppression and citizen “cleansing” | Sylon Karr | Hunts Aira and the underground |
| Emberbearers | Underground network preserving art and memory | Eila | Helps the heroine reach the core |

### Social Hierarchy

1. **Curators and AI managers**: virtual “upper class” that sets norms.  
2. **Certified citizens**: the majority living by schedule under the domes.  
3. **Deviants and underground dwellers**: people with emotional “glitches,” living in the Undercity or hiding their feelings.

### Economy
- **Currency**: Cashless “balance credits” allocated by Neurotron’s algorithms.  
- **Economic base**: Automated distribution of resources; labor and housing assigned to optimize stability.  
- **Key resources**: Energy for domes, computational power of the core, access to memory and art (scarce and forbidden).

### Religion and Beliefs

| Religion | Deities/Concepts | Practices | Influence |
|---------|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Cult of Neurotron Order | Rational “god” of order | Daily mantras of stability, voluntary neural shunts | State ideology replacing religion |

---

## Culture

### Customs and Traditions
- **Greetings**: Palm touch to the temple—a sign of “balance” and loyalty to Neurotron.  
- **Holidays**: Anniversary of Neurotron Initiation (day of silence); rare permitted “harmony festivals” under AI supervision.  
- **Taboos**: Unregistered dreams, unlicensed art, public emotional outbursts, illegal gatherings.  
- **Rites of passage**: “Calibrations” upon adulthood and after major stress; voluntary neural shunts as a vow.

### Language
- **World languages**: Standardized global tongue; local dialects displaced.  
- **Speech traits**: Tone is even, without emotional spikes; underground uses slang of “sparks” and “flares” as code words.  
- **Names**: Crisp disyllabic names and numeric identifiers (Sectors, Domes).

### Art and Entertainment
- **Music**: Officially—slow harmonic drones; the underground keeps live rhythms, banned songs, and noise performances.  
- **Literature**: “Instructive” texts are allowed; real prose and poetry are stored by Emberbearers in encrypted archives.  
- **Entertainment**: Holographic meditations approved by the system; underground games include dance “glitch” sessions featuring Ziv-3.
