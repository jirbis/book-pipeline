## Workflow

### Phase 1: Research
1. Gather sources → `research/sources.md`
2. Conduct interviews → `research/interviews.md`
3. Systematize data → `research/data.md`
4. Collect key quotes → `research/quotes.md`

### Phase 2: Planning
1. Define the book’s “big idea”
2. Create `outline.md` — detailed plan
3. For each chapter define:
   - Main thesis
   - Supporting arguments
   - Examples and stories
   - Practical takeaways

### Phase 3: Writing
1. Write chapters in the order convenient to the author
2. Each chapter → separate file
3. First draft — no editing
4. Goal: 500–2000 words per session

### Phase 4: Editing
1. Structural edit (order, logic)
2. Stylistic edit (clarity, voice)
3. Line edit (sentences, wording)
4. Proofread (grammar, punctuation)
