## Concept

### Logline (1 sentence)

A candid field guide from a trader who burned out on gambling behaviors and learned to survive—and profit—by treating crypto like a probability game with strict risk discipline.

### Synopsis (1 paragraph)

The book speaks to overwhelmed beginners and bruised returnees who have chased pumps, overleveraged, and lost; it reframes crypto from casino to navigable high-risk ecosystem, compares platforms without hype, shows which coin categories merit attention, and uses the author’s biggest wins and worst losses to illustrate how a simple, repeatable strategy built on position sizing, market regimes, and emotional control can keep traders solvent long enough to become consistently profitable.

### Key themes
1. Survival through disciplined risk and position sizing
2. Platform fluency and security-minded operational habits
3. Narrative-aware coin selection (Bitcoin/Ethereum as anchors vs. short-lived alt narratives)
4. Lessons from personal wins and losses as operating principles
5. Profit-taking and mental health as core parts of the system
