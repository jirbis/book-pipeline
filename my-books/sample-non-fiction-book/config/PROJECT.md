## Концепция

### Логлайн (1 предложение)
> A field guide for new crypto traders who want to survive long enough to become profitable by trading systematically, not emotionally.

### Синопсис (1 абзац)
This book is written for new and early-stage crypto traders who feel both fascinated and intimidated by the crypto markets. It is not a get-rich-quick manual, nor a technical textbook—it is a field guide, written by someone who has already paid the tuition fee many times over. Through hard-earned experience trading on eToro, Binance, Coinbase, and other platforms, this book distills a clear, realistic, and repeatable approach to trading crypto. You'll learn how to survive long enough to become profitable, stop trading emotionally, treat crypto as a probability game, and grow capital while protecting yourself from catastrophic loss.

### Ключевые темы
1. Market reality and trader psychology
2. Platform selection and risk management
3. Systematic trading vs emotional gambling
4. Sustainable profitability through discipline
