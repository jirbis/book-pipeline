# Chapter 14 — Entry, Exit, and Risk Control

## Goal
Give readers a simple, repeatable playbook for entries, exits, and risk management that prevents good ideas from turning into big losses.

## Thesis
Entries matter far less than predefined exits and risk controls; disciplined stops and profit targets protect you from your own conviction.

## Section Outline
### Opening — Perfect entry, terrible outcome
- Story of nailing an entry but refusing to use a stop.

### Section 1 — Entry strategies
- Confirmation over prediction (breakouts, retests, trend alignment).
- Avoiding knife-catching without a plan.

### Section 2 — Stop losses as non-negotiable
- Types of stops (hard, trailing, time-based).
- Placing stops based on structure, not feelings.

### Section 3 — Take profit planning
- Scaling out vs. full exits; setting partial targets.
- Risk/reward ratios and why 1:2 is the baseline.

### Section 4 — Managing open risk
- Moving stops to break-even; when to give trades room.
- Handling gaps/illiquidity and funding costs on leveraged products.

### Closing and transition
- Summarize: your rules decide outcomes more than your predictions.
- Transition to Chapter 15 on surviving inevitable drawdowns.

## Examples and Stories
- Bad entry/good exit vs. perfect entry/no stop comparisons.
- A trade saved by a pre-planned stop and profit ladder.

## Data/Research Targets
- Personal trade logs segmented by R:R and stop discipline.
- Simple backtests of exit strategies.

## Drafting Notes
- Include checklists readers can tape to their monitor.
- Stress that abandoning stops is a choice, not a necessity.
