# Chapter 17 — Compounding Without Increasing Stress

## Goal
Teach readers to grow accounts steadily by emphasizing consistency over aggressive risk escalation.

## Thesis
True compounding comes from repeatable small wins and disciplined withdrawals of profits—not from doubling size after each victory.

## Section Outline
### Opening — The temptation to double after a win
- Story of bumping size too fast and the stress that followed.

### Section 1 — The math of steady compounding
- Small, consistent R multiples accumulating over time.
- How churn and fees erode aggressive scaling.

### Section 2 — Separating lifestyle and trading capital
- Paying yourself to reduce emotional attachment to open P&L.
- Creating a “house money” buffer.

### Section 3 — When and how to scale up
- Criteria for increasing size (sample of trades, drawdown recovery).
- Incremental size bumps vs. leaps.

### Section 4 — Stress management as part of risk management
- Sleep, screen time, alerts—notifying you when to step away.
- Recognizing physical signs of overtrading.

### Closing and transition
- Emphasize sustainable habits over quick compounding fantasies.
- Transition to Chapter 18 on building a long-term routine in a 24/7 market.

## Examples and Stories
- How siphoning profits to a cold wallet reduced risk-taking pressure.
- A failed attempt to scale too fast that increased error rate.

## Data/Research Targets
- Risk-of-ruin calculations under different sizing ramps.
- Personal metrics showing performance before/after withdrawals.

## Drafting Notes
- Keep advice actionable with thresholds (e.g., increase size after X R profit with drawdown under Y%).
- Tone: calm, methodical, anti-gambling.
