# Chapter 10 — Trades That Made Life-Changing Money

## Goal
Dissect the few trades that materially changed your finances to extract repeatable principles (not just lucky anecdotes).

## Thesis
The biggest wins came from patience, positioning, and disciplined profit-taking—not perfect timing—so readers should focus on controllable behaviors.

## Section Outline
### Opening — The trade that changed everything
- Hook with the most impactful trade and its emotional context.
- Tease the common thread across all major wins.

### Section 1 — Trade #1: Early Bitcoin accumulation
- Why it worked: conviction + time horizon + cautious sizing.
- How you handled volatility and took partial profits.

### Section 2 — Trade #2: Altcoin cycle timing
- Recognizing narrative momentum and exit signals.
- Balancing greed with structured scaling out.

### Section 3 — Trade #3: Shorting near a top
- Pattern recognition and confirmation, not prediction.
- Risk controls that kept the short from blowing up.

### Section 4 — Common ingredients
- Position sizing discipline, patience, and pre-planned exits.
- Support system: journals, alerts, and rules.

### Closing and transition
- Emphasize that these wins were rare and preparation-dependent.
- Lead into Chapter 11 on losses that erased gains when rules were ignored.

## Examples and Stories
- Entry/exit details, screenshots, and journaling notes for each trade.
- Moments when you almost sabotaged the win and how you resisted.

## Data/Research Targets
- Reconstruct P&L from journal entries and exchange exports.
- Market context around each win (volatility, funding, news).

## Drafting Notes
- Avoid glamorizing; quantify risk taken and luck involved.
- Pair each win with a specific lesson readers can apply.
