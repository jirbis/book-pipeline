# Chapter 16 — When and How to Take Profits

## Goal
Show readers how to lock in gains systematically so winners stay wins instead of round-tripping back to losses.

## Thesis
Profit-taking feels wrong because of human psychology; predefined scaling plans and trailing stops turn emotional decisions into mechanical actions.

## Section Outline
### Opening — Watching a 300% gain fade to 50%
- The sickening feeling of giving back a huge win.

### Section 1 — Why taking profits feels bad
- Loss aversion vs. fear of missing out on more upside.
- The myth of selling the absolute top.

### Section 2 — Scaling out strategies
- Partial profits at key levels; keeping a runner.
- How scaling changes average exit price and psychology.

### Section 3 — Protecting gains in real time
- Moving stops to break-even; trailing stops that follow structure.
- Locking in gains before major events (news, unlocks).

### Section 4 — When to take full profits
- Signals to close a position entirely (trend breaks, thesis invalidation).
- Converting paper gains into cash or BTC/ETH core.

### Closing and transition
- Reinforce that selling is a skill; profits fund survival and the next trade.
- Lead into Chapter 17 on compounding without adding stress.

## Examples and Stories
- Trades where early partials preserved capital despite later reversals.
- Times you held too long and watched gains evaporate.

## Data/Research Targets
- Personal trade data showing outcomes with/without scaling.
- Studies on optimal exit strategies or trailing stops.

## Drafting Notes
- Provide sample scaling ladders and stop-move rules.
- Normalize “leaving money on the table” as the cost of staying solvent.
