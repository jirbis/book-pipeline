# Chapter 18 — Sustainable Trading in a 24/7 Market

## Goal
Help readers design a trading routine that preserves mental health and performance in a market that never closes.

## Thesis
Sustainability beats intensity: setting boundaries, schedules, and automation keeps you trading next year instead of burning out next month.

## Section Outline
### Opening — Burnout from 18-hour chart watching
- Describe the exhaustion and diminishing returns of nonstop monitoring.

### Section 1 — Why you don’t need to trade every day
- Opportunity selection vs. compulsive participation.
- The cost of overtrading in fees and mental fatigue.

### Section 2 — Designing trading hours and routines
- Time blocks for research, execution, review.
- Alert systems to replace constant screen-watching.

### Section 3 — Mental health and boundaries
- Sleep hygiene, exercise, and digital detox habits.
- Rules for stepping away after emotional spikes (win or loss).

### Section 4 — When to pause entirely
- Signals that mean “take a break” (sloppy errors, tunnel vision).
- How breaks often improve decision quality and profitability.

### Closing and transition
- Frame sustainability as the final edge that keeps all other skills usable.
- Set up the Conclusion’s synthesis and next steps.

## Examples and Stories
- The month you stopped trading and made better decisions afterward.
- A simple alert setup that reduced screen time without missing key moves.

## Data/Research Targets
- Studies on trader burnout and decision fatigue.
- Personal metrics comparing performance during high vs. low screen time.

## Drafting Notes
- Offer a sample weekly schedule and checklist for shutting down.
- Keep tone encouraging: permission to rest is part of professionalism.
