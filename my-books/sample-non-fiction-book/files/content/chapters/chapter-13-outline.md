# Chapter 13 — Market Regimes and Position Sizing

## Goal
Teach readers to identify market regimes and adjust position sizes accordingly, making sizing the core edge instead of prediction.

## Thesis
Position sizing beats forecasting: once you classify the market as bull, bear, or range, you can choose sizes and trade frequency that keep you solvent.

## Section Outline
### Opening — When sizing replaced predictions
- Moment you stopped trying to call tops/bottoms and focused on size.

### Section 1 — Defining regimes
- Criteria for bull, bear, and range (price structure, volatility, funding, breadth).
- How to confirm regime shifts instead of guessing them.

### Section 2 — Position sizing framework
- Fixed percentage risk per trade.
- Adjusting size by conviction and regime; caps per asset.

### Section 3 — Scaling rules
- Scaling in/out vs. all-in/all-out.
- Reducing size during uncertainty or after drawdowns.

### Section 4 — Metrics that matter
- Expectancy, risk of ruin, max drawdown tolerance.
- Tracking wins/losses by regime to refine sizing.

### Closing and transition
- Reinforce sizing as the lever that makes strategies survivable.
- Lead into Chapter 14 on entries/exits/risk control mechanics.

## Examples and Stories
- How smaller sizing kept you in the game during the 2022 bear market.
- Case where scaling down stopped a losing streak.

## Data/Research Targets
- Historical volatility/regime markers for BTC/ETH.
- Position sizing models (fixed %, Kelly-lite) with examples.

## Drafting Notes
- Provide simple calculators/checklists readers can copy.
- Keep math approachable; emphasize practical ranges over precision.
