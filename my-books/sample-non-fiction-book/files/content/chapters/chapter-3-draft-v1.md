> **Purpose:** Show how the team turns a research-backed sketch into a visible, running experiment that collects feedback within the week.

Drafts die quietly when no one knows they exist. This chapter opens with a simple launch rule: every playbook ships with a date, an owner, and a place to watch the metric move. The lead posts the Chapter 1 experiment in the team channel with two artifacts—a one-page summary and a 60-second screen recording that walks through the triage steps. The message pins the baseline metric and the expected change, so everyone can see the wager being made.

Execution stays narrow. The team schedules a five-day pilot with two squads and assigns a reviewer rotation ahead of time. Prep packets live in the same doc as the checklist, and the owner sets a recurring reminder to nudge reviewers if the queue grows past a single item. At midweek, they publish a 90-second update noting what slipped, what stayed on time, and any blockers from the security counterexample in Chapter 2.

Feedback is treated like data, not opinion. The owner collects four signals: median review-to-approval time, number of escalations, reviewer satisfaction (one-question pulse), and any incidents. At the end of the week, they post a simple before/after chart and decide: keep, tweak, or cut. Whatever the decision, the artifacts stay public so the next iteration can reference what changed and why.
