# Chapter 12 — Emotional Traps and the Lies Traders Tell Themselves

## Goal
Expose the recurring mental scripts that sabotage traders and provide practical ways to catch yourself before they cause damage.

## Thesis
The biggest enemy is the internal narrative that justifies bad decisions; replacing those lies with objective rules is key to survival.

## Section Outline
### Opening — "It's just a temporary dip"
- Common self-soothing line before deeper losses.
- Link to previous chapter’s losses.

### Section 1 — Revenge trading after losses
- The impulse to win it back fast.
- Cooling-off rules and position-size caps.

### Section 2 — Overconfidence after wins
- Sloppy sizing and rule-breaking once you feel invincible.
- Techniques to reset to baseline risk.

### Section 3 — Confirmation bias and echo chambers
- Seeking content that supports existing positions.
- Building a habit of writing the bear case.

### Section 4 — Reframing lies as rules
- "Long-term investor now" → precommitment to exit criteria.
- "This time is different" → checklist for evidence.

### Closing and transition
- Encourage readers to write their own lie-to-rule conversions.
- Transition to Part V: the system that finally worked.

## Examples and Stories
- Journal excerpts where you renamed losses as "investments".
- A revenge-trade spiral and how you broke it.

## Data/Research Targets
- Behavioral finance studies on loss aversion and overconfidence.
- Personal metrics showing performance before/after rules.

## Drafting Notes
- Keep tone empathetic but firm; normalize the feelings while rejecting the behaviors.
