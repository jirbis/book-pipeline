> **Purpose:** Show how the pipeline moves from a filled-out PROJECT.md to a usable first-draft page in under half an hour.

The fastest way to lose a team is to promise momentum and deliver paperwork. This chapter opens with that gap: a head of delivery wants a thin playbook her leads can actually use this quarter, not a manifesto that dies in their inbox. The book’s promise is modest and sharp—ship a usable draft in days, keep iterating in public—and this first pass demonstrates what “usable” looks like.

Picture a small product team pushing to cut cycle time by 20% before their next board update. They know the bottleneck: decisions stall whenever stories jump swimlanes. In a 20-minute working session, they translate that pain into one observable metric—time from “ready for review” to “approved”—and sketch a single intervention: daily 10-minute triage with a rotating reviewer. That specificity is what turns PROJECT.md into a page people can test tomorrow.

We keep the constraint explicit. This sprint leaves citations, vendor comparisons, and long-form interviews for later; the goal is to capture a plausible path that research can either validate or falsify. The brevity is deliberate so the pipeline demo shows real progress with minimal lag. Next, Researcher should pull a benchmark for teams of similar size and one contrasting example where triage failed, so the second pass can anchor the claim without bloating the prose.
