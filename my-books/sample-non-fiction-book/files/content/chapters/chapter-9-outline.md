# Chapter 9 — Which Coins Deserve Your Capital

## Goal
Give readers a practical framework for allocating capital across coin categories while accepting that most altcoins are temporary narratives.

## Thesis
Treat altcoins as short-lived trades within a structured allocation—reserve core capital for durable assets and rotate the rest based on clear criteria and time limits.

## Section Outline
### Opening — The altcoin graveyard
- Quick roll call of once-hyped projects now at near-zero.
- Sets urgency for disciplined allocation.

### Section 1 — Functional categories
- Base layers, DeFi, infrastructure, AI, memes, and niche sectors.
- What each category tends to do in different market regimes.

### Section 2 — Allocation framework
- Core (BTC/ETH), satellite (quality alts), speculative (narrative punts).
- Position sizing rules and portfolio caps per bucket.

### Section 3 — Timing narrative cycles
- How to spot early momentum vs. late-stage euphoria.
- Indicators for rotating out (volume decay, unlocks, token incentives drying up).

### Section 4 — When to exit and rotate
- Predefined profit/loss triggers.
- Moving gains back to core holdings; protecting principal.

### Closing and transition
- Reinforce that not holding is a valid choice; cash and BTC/ETH are positions.
- Transition to Part IV with personal stories of wins/losses that illustrate these principles.

## Examples and Stories
- Profiting on meme coins with strict size limits and fast exits.
- Projects you believed in that still went to zero.

## Data/Research Targets
- Historical survival rates of altcoins by cohort (ICO, DeFi, NFT).
- Unlock schedules and tokenomics as exit triggers.
- Portfolio allocation studies specific to crypto.

## Drafting Notes
- Provide simple worksheets/checklists for readers to apply immediately.
- Keep tone sober: emphasize odds and capital protection.
