> **Purpose:** Show how the Researcher role upgrades the sketch from Chapter 1 into a defendable, source-backed page without losing speed.

Research starts with a narrow question: *Is a 10-minute daily triage enough to cut review time by 20% for a five-person product team?* The researcher gathers two kinds of evidence. First, a benchmark: a 2023 DORA-style survey of teams under 15 people shows median review-to-approval at 14 hours; teams that add scheduled reviewer rotation cut it to 8 hours within two weeks. Second, a counterexample: one security-heavy team saw no gain because reviewers lacked context, highlighting the need for “prep packets” before the meeting.

The write-up stays concise—two sentences per source, linked in-line. Instead of a literature dump, the chapter pulls out one quoted data point and one brief anecdote that mirrors the case study from Chapter 1. The goal is not academic rigor; it is enough credibility for a lead to try the experiment and justify the calendar slot.

Constraints stay visible. If a citation cannot be verified quickly, the draft flags it as a placeholder with a note for a future pass. The chapter closes with a test card: *Hypothesis*: rotating reviewer plus prep packets reduces review-to-approval time by 30% in three sprints. *Metric*: median hours from “ready for review” to “approved.” *Next move*: capture baseline this week, publish the graph in the next draft.
