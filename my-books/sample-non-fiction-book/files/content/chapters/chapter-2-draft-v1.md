# Chapter 2: How Exchanges Make Money Regardless of Your Success

The first time I calculated how much I'd paid in trading fees, I felt sick.

It was late 2021, and I had just finished what I thought was a decent trading month. I'd made fourteen trades, won on nine of them, and ended up +$2,100. Not bad, right? I was feeling pretty good about myself until I decided to actually add up the fees.

Binance: $127 in trading fees
eToro: $89 hidden in spreads
Two withdrawals to my wallet: $45 in network fees

Total fees: $261

That's 12.4% of my profit. Gone. Just for the privilege of playing the game.

And here's the kicker: that was a *winning* month. The month before, when I lost $1,800, I still paid $340 in fees. The exchange made money whether I did or not.

That's when I realized: **I'm not the customer. I'm the product.**

## The House Always Wins (And You're Paying for It)

Let's start with an uncomfortable truth: crypto exchanges are not your friend. They're not "democratizing finance" or "empowering retail investors." They're businesses. Very profitable businesses. And their profits come from one place: you.

According to public financial data, Binance generated over $20 billion in revenue in 2021. Coinbase reported $7.8 billion. These are staggering numbers—and every dollar came from trader fees, spreads, and various other charges.

Here's what most traders don't understand: **the exchange's ideal customer is not someone who makes money. It's someone who trades frequently.**

Think about it. If you buy Bitcoin, hold it for a year, and sell at a profit, the exchange makes two small fees. That's it. But if you make 100 trades in that same year? They make 100x the fees. Your profitability is irrelevant to their bottom line.

This misalignment of incentives shapes everything about how exchanges operate.

## Trading Fees: The Visible Cost

Let's break down the most obvious revenue stream: trading fees.

**Binance** charges 0.1% per trade (0.075% if you hold BNB and use it for fee discounts). That sounds tiny, right? But let's do the math.

If you trade $10,000 worth of crypto, you pay $10 in fees. Buy and sell? That's $20. Do this ten times in a month? $200. Over a year of active trading? $2,400 just in basic fees.

And that's if you're getting the *discounted* rate.

**Coinbase** is worse. Their standard fee structure ranges from 0.5% to 3.99% depending on payment method and trade size. New traders often pay 1.49% without realizing it. That $10,000 trade? $149 in fees. Both sides of the trade? $298.

Do that ten times and you've paid $2,980 in fees—nearly 30% of your trading capital if you started with $10,000.

**eToro** hides fees in the spread—the difference between buying and selling price. They claim "zero commission," which is technically true, but misleading. The spread on Bitcoin can be 0.75% or more. On altcoins? Sometimes 2-3%. You're paying; it's just less visible.

Here's a personal example: I once bought Ethereum on eToro at what showed as $3,420. I checked CoinGecko immediately after—the actual market price was $3,395. I paid a $25 premium on a $3,400 purchase. That's a 0.73% hidden fee before I even had a chance to make or lose money.

## Spreads: The Invisible Tax

The spread is the gap between the price you pay to buy (ask) and the price you get when you sell (bid).

On a liquid asset like Bitcoin during normal market conditions, this might only be $50-100 on a $60,000 Bitcoin. That's roughly 0.08-0.17%—not too bad.

But watch what happens when:
1. You trade a less liquid altcoin
2. The market gets volatile
3. You're trading outside of peak hours

I learned this the hard way with a small-cap altcoin on Binance. The "market price" showed $2.45. I placed a market buy order and got filled at $2.52. A 2.8% instant loss before the price even moved.

Why? Because there wasn't enough liquidity at $2.45. My order ate through several price levels, and I got the average of what was available. This is called *slippage*, and it's brutal on smaller coins.

The exchange doesn't advertise this. They just show you the "market price" and fill your order at whatever they can. The difference? That's their profit (and the profit of market makers who provide liquidity).

## Leverage Fees: The Wealth Transfer Machine

Here's where exchanges really make money: leverage trading.

When you trade with leverage, you're borrowing money from the exchange. They charge you for this privilege in multiple ways:

**1. Funding Rates**

If you hold a leveraged position overnight, you pay (or sometimes receive) a funding rate. This is typically 0.01-0.03% every 8 hours, which sounds small until you realize that's 0.03-0.09% per day, or roughly 11-33% annually.

I once held a 5x long Bitcoin position for two weeks, thinking I was being strategic. The position barely moved, but I paid $180 in funding fees on a $5,000 position. That's 3.6% erosion just for sitting there.

**2. Liquidation as Revenue**

When your leveraged position moves against you past a certain point, the exchange automatically closes it—liquidates you—to prevent you from owing them money.

Here's the thing: they don't liquidate you exactly at the price where your margin runs out. They have a *liquidation buffer*. On Binance, for example, if you're using 10x leverage, you might get liquidated when your position is down 8% instead of 10%. That 2% buffer? The exchange keeps it.

During the May 2021 crash, over $10 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in a single day. A significant chunk of that went straight to exchange coffers as "liquidation fees."

I contributed $4,200 to that total. Thanks, Binance.

**3. Higher Trading Fees**

Some exchanges charge higher fees for futures/margin trading than for spot trading. Binance charges 0.02% maker / 0.04% taker for futures. Doesn't sound like much, but if you're actively trading futures, that adds up fast.

In one particularly stupid week, I made 37 futures trades. My total fees: $890. Almost a thousand dollars to a platform that profited whether my trades won or lost.

## Withdrawal Fees: The Exit Tax

Want to move your crypto off the exchange? That'll cost you.

Network fees (gas fees for Ethereum, transaction fees for Bitcoin) are real—someone has to pay miners/validators. But exchanges often charge *way* more than the actual network cost.

Example from late 2021:
- Actual Ethereum gas fee: $15-20
- Binance withdrawal fee: $18
- Coinbase withdrawal fee: Free (but they cover it by making you pay more elsewhere)
- eToro withdrawal fee: $5 (but minimum withdrawal is $30)

On Bitcoin withdrawals, I've seen exchanges charge 0.0005 BTC ($30 at $60k prices) when the actual network fee is 0.0001 BTC ($6). They pocket the difference.

The real trick? Many exchanges *batch* withdrawals—combining multiple user withdrawals into one transaction to save on network fees—but still charge each user the full amount. Pure profit.

## The Copy Trading Illusion

eToro is particularly clever with their "social trading" and copy trading features.

Here's how it works: you can copy a "successful" trader's positions automatically. eToro makes this seem free and easy. What they don't clearly explain:

1. You pay the spread on every position that gets copied
2. If the trader you're copying makes 50 trades a month, you're paying spreads on 50 trades
3. The "successful" trader might be up 30% for the year, but you're down 5% after spreads

I copied a trader who was supposedly up 47% over 12 months. After three months, he was still up around 45%. I was up 11%. Where did the 34% difference go?

Spreads. On every. Single. Trade.

He was making 8-12 trades per week. Each one cost me 0.5-1.5% in hidden spreads. By the time those costs compounded, my returns were completely different from his—even though we held identical positions.

eToro made money on every trade he made. I paid for his activity. He got paid for having copiers (eToro compensates popular traders). eToro got rich. I got a valuable lesson in reading the fine print.

## Why Exchanges Want You to Trade More

Let me make this extremely clear: **every feature, notification, and design choice on an exchange is engineered to make you trade more frequently.**

**Push notifications** about price movements? Not to help you—to trigger FOMO and urgency.

**"Hot coins" lists and "top movers"** sections? To make you feel like you're missing out.

**One-click trading**? To reduce friction between impulse and execution.

**Leverage up to 125x**? Not because it's a good idea (it's not), but because it generates more fees and more liquidations.

**Free trading competitions and bonuses**? To habituate you to constant trading.

**Trading bots and API access**? So you can automate the process of paying them fees 24/7.

I fell for all of it. In my worst month, I made 61 trades. I ended down $900 in P&L, but I paid $1,240 in fees. The exchange had a profitable month. I didn't.

## The Free Lunch That Isn't

Some exchanges advertise "zero fees" or "commission-free trading." This is marketing, not reality.

**Robinhood** (yes, they have crypto now) claims no fees. What they actually do:
- Route your order through market makers who pay them for "order flow"
- You get slightly worse prices; the market maker and Robinhood split the difference
- It's a fee, just hidden and called something else

**eToro** claims "zero commission." As we've covered, they make it back in spreads.

**PayPal** and **Venmo** crypto services have no trading fees—but you can't withdraw your crypto. You're trading IOUs, not actual crypto. And their buy/sell spread is often 1-2% higher than you'd pay on a real exchange.

There is no free lunch in crypto. If you're not paying an obvious fee, you're paying a hidden one.

## How to Minimize the Damage

Okay, so exchanges are designed to extract maximum fees from you. What can you do about it?

**1. Trade less**

This is the single most effective strategy. Every trade you don't make is a fee you don't pay. That sounds obvious, but it's profound: the best way to beat exchange fees is to not trade.

In 2022, I went from averaging 25 trades per month to 6 trades per month. My fees dropped from ~$600/month to ~$120/month. That's $5,760 per year saved—just by being more selective.

**2. Use limit orders, not market orders**

Market orders pay "taker" fees (usually higher). Limit orders can pay "maker" fees (usually lower, sometimes even negative on some exchanges).

On Binance, the difference is 0.1% (taker) vs 0.1% (maker) for basic users, but with fee discounts it becomes 0.075% vs 0.02%. On larger trades, that adds up.

**3. Understand the fee structure of your platform**

Read the actual fee schedule. Know what you're paying. Factor it into your trades.

If you're paying 0.5% to enter and 0.5% to exit, your breakeven isn't 0%—it's 1%. You need to be right by more than the fee spread just to break even.

**4. Withdraw strategically**

Don't make ten small withdrawals. Batch them. If you're paying a $30 withdrawal fee, withdrawing $500 is a 6% cost. Withdrawing $5,000 is a 0.6% cost.

Also: check if the exchange has free withdrawal days or lower-fee withdrawal methods (some offer certain networks with lower fees).

**5. Consider fee rebates and loyalty programs**

Many exchanges offer reduced fees if you hold their native token (BNB on Binance, for example) or trade above certain volumes. If you're going to trade regardless, these can help—but don't let the tail wag the dog. Don't trade *more* just to get *cheaper* fees.

**6. Compare platforms for your use case**

If you're buying and holding, Coinbase Pro might make more sense than regular Coinbase (lower fees). If you're trading frequently, Binance's lower fees might save you thousands over eToro.

But remember: the cheapest platform is the one where you make the fewest trades.

## The Real Cost: Opportunity

Here's the part that really hurts: the fees you pay to exchanges could be compounding in your portfolio instead.

Let's say you pay $400/month in trading fees (not uncommon for an active trader). That's $4,800/year. Over five years? $24,000. If you had invested that money in Bitcoin at an average return of 40%/year (conservative for Bitcoin's historical average), that $24,000 would be worth $82,000.

You paid $82,000 for the privilege of trading instead of holding.

I did the math on my 2021 trading. I paid $8,400 in fees that year. If I had bought Bitcoin on January 1st with that $8,400 instead of paying it to exchanges throughout the year, and sold on December 31st, it would have been worth $9,800 (Bitcoin was up about 60% that year, despite the crash).

I paid nearly $10,000 for the privilege of making trades that mostly went nowhere.

## What This Means for You

Exchanges are not evil. They provide a valuable service: access to crypto markets. But they are businesses, and their business model is to maximize trading volume, not your profits.

Understanding this changes how you should think about trading:

1. **Every trade has a real cost** beyond just whether the price goes up or down
2. **Frequent trading makes the exchange rich**, not you
3. **The more features and tools an exchange offers**, the more ways they have to generate fees
4. **"Free" almost always means hidden fees** somewhere else
5. **The house always wins** unless you play a different game

The different game? Trade less. Hold longer. Be more selective. Accept that boring is profitable.

In Chapter 3, we'll talk about why volatility isn't your enemy—but leverage is. And why understanding the difference between trading and gambling might be the most important lesson in this entire book.
