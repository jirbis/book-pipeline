# Chapter 8 — Ethereum and the Altcoin Ecosystem

## Goal
Explain why Ethereum behaves differently from Bitcoin and how that difference shapes altcoin opportunities and risks.

## Thesis
Ethereum’s utility and evolving ecosystem make it the gateway to altcoins; treating it like Bitcoin leads to misreads in timing, volatility, and narrative cycles.

## Section Outline
### Opening — ETH as the on-ramp
- Personal realization that ETH exposure unlocked entire sectors (DeFi/NFTs).
- ETH/BTC ratio as a signal of shifting narratives.

### Section 1 — Utility vs. store of value
- Smart contracts, gas, and fees as economic signals.
- How network congestion affects trading strategies.

### Section 2 — Layer 1 rivals and Layer 2 scaling
- Quick comparisons: Solana, Avalanche, etc.
- Layer 2s changing fee structures and throughput.

### Section 3 — Narratives that move altcoins
- DeFi summers, NFT booms, AI tokens, memecoins.
- How narratives rotate and how to spot exhaustion.

### Section 4 — Evaluating altcoin candidates
- Liquidity, token unlock schedules, real usage vs. hype.
- Risk frameworks for sizing altcoin trades vs. BTC/ETH core.

### Closing and transition
- Reiterate: ETH = gateway, but narratives are fleeting.
- Bridge to Chapter 9 on capital allocation across categories.

## Examples and Stories
- Riding the DeFi summer wave via ETH-based tokens.
- Getting wrecked chasing an “ETH killer” that faded post-hype.

## Data/Research Targets
- ETH/BTC ratio trends during past cycles.
- Layer 1/L2 comparison metrics (TPS, fees, uptime).
- Narrative cycle case studies (ICO, DeFi, NFT, AI).

## Drafting Notes
- Clarify jargon; define narratives quickly before analyzing them.
- Emphasize rotational thinking: when to be in ETH vs. alt baskets.
