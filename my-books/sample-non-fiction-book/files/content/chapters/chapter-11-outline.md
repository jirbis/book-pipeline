# Chapter 11 — Trades That Wiped Out Months of Gains

## Goal
Show how a few bad decisions erased progress, and distill safeguards so readers avoid the same drawdowns.

## Thesis
Every major loss traced back to abandoning the system—overleveraging, ignoring stops, or trading narratives instead of setups—proving discipline matters more than conviction.

## Section Outline
### Opening — The overnight liquidation
- Set the emotional scene of the hardest hit.

### Section 2 — Loss #2: Holding through a bear market
- Turning a trade into a “long-term investment” to avoid pain.
- Opportunity cost and psychological drag.

### Section 3 — Loss #3: FOMO buying a pump
- Entering late on hype, no plan for exit.
- How confirmation bias kept you in as momentum faded.

### Section 4 — Common patterns and corrections
- Emotion over system; lack of predefined exits.
- Safeguards: smaller size, mandatory stops, cooling-off periods.

### Closing and transition
- Frame losses as tuition; you only benefit if you change behavior.
- Transition to Chapter 12 on emotional traps that enable these errors.
