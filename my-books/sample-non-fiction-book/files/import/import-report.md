# Import Report — Surviving Crypto

**Import date**: 2026-01-04  
**Source**: `files/import/original/crypto-trader-synopsis.md`  
**Processed by**: Importer

## Files Processed

| Original file | Detected type | Confidence | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| files/import/original/crypto-trader-synopsis.md | Synopsis / book proposal | High | Kept in `files/import/original/`; used to populate `config/PROJECT.md` and high-level plan | Contains 6-part structure, platform/coin focus, personal wins/losses |

### Backups
- Original files saved to `files/import/original/`.

## What Was Created/Updated
- `config/PROJECT.md` populated with title, genre, audience, status `imported`, key themes, and part-level outline derived from the synopsis.
- Import metadata recorded here for traceability.

## Next Steps for Author/Orchestrator
- [ ] Confirm target wordcount (~70k) and chapter/part breakdown.
- [ ] Validate platform details (eToro, Binance, Coinbase) and add any regional constraints.
- [ ] Add personal trade logs to support Part IV case studies.
- [ ] Expand outline into chapter-level entries with estimated wordcounts.
- [ ] Fill `config/author-voice.md` with stylistic samples to guide drafting.

## Issues or Ambiguities
- The synopsis references platform comparisons and personal trades; specific data and dates need verification.
- No raw chapter drafts were provided—only the synopsis—so content still needs drafting from scratch.
