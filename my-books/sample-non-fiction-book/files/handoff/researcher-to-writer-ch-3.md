## Key Findings

1. **Extreme Volatility**: Bitcoin's 60-80% volatility vs. 15-20% for S&P 500 means 20-30% daily swings are normal
2. **Leverage Mathematics**: 5x leverage means 20% adverse move = total loss; math is unforgiving in volatile markets
3. **Trading vs. Gambling**: Differentiated by process (position sizing, exit strategy, emotion control) not asset class
4. **Liquidation Certainty**: On high leverage, liquidation is not "if" but "when" given crypto's historical volatility
5. **Position Sizing**: Professional standard is 1-2% risk per trade, meaning 5-10% position sizes for crypto spot trading
