## Key Findings

### Finding 1: High Failure Rate Among Crypto Traders
- **Source**: Investopedia study, Bloomberg Analytics research
- **Fact**: 80-95% of retail crypto traders lose money, with the failure rate highest among new traders (90% in first year)
- **Relevance**: Sets the honest tone for the introduction - this is not a "get rich quick" guide but a survival manual

### Finding 2: Emotional Trading is the Primary Cause
- **Source**: CoinDesk Research on trading psychology
- **Fact**: Fear and greed drive most trading decisions, particularly in volatile 24/7 crypto markets. FOMO (fear of missing out) causes buying at tops, panic selling causes exits at bottoms.
- **Relevance**: Introduces the central problem the book addresses - emotional vs. systematic trading

### Finding 3: Leverage and Fees Compound Losses
- **Source**: Bloomberg Analytics, Journal of Finance study
- **Fact**: Most significant losses come from overleveraging (using borrowed money to amplify positions) and underestimating cumulative fees. Even "small" 0.1% fees add up to 36.5% annually for daily traders.
- **Relevance**: Helps explain the mechanism behind losses, not just bad luck

### Finding 4: Survivorship Bias in Success Stories
- **Source**: Investopedia, CoinDesk Research
- **Fact**: Media coverage focuses on rare success stories, creating false perception of easy profits. For every viral "made $100k" story, thousands lost money quietly.
- **Relevance**: Counters the hype and sets realistic expectations

## Examples & Case Studies

1. **Example 1**: The $47k Liquidation Story
   - Description: Personal account of overleveraging on a Bitcoin position during May 2021 crash, losing 6 months of gains in one liquidation event
   - Source: Author's trading journal
   - Relevance: Opening hook for introduction - concrete, relatable disaster that sets the tone

2. **Example 2**: The Hidden Cost of "Free" Trading
   - Description: Calculation showing how a trader making 10 trades/day on "0.1% fee" exchange pays $3,650 annually on a $10k account
   - Source: Fee analysis from major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, eToro)
   - Relevance: Demonstrates that exchanges profit regardless of trader success

3. **Example 3**: The Diamond Hands Trap
   - Description: Case study of holding a meme coin from $10k to $80k back down to $2k, refusing to take profits due to "HODL" culture
   - Source: Multiple Reddit threads, personal observations
   - Relevance: Shows how crypto culture can reinforce bad trading behavior
