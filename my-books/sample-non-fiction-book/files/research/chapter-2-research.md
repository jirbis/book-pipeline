## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Trading Fees Are the Primary Revenue Stream
- **Source**: Forbes and CoinDesk research
- **Fact**: Top exchanges earn $3-5 billion annually from trading fees. Standard retail fee is 0.1-0.5% per trade (both buy and sell), meaning a $10k position costs $20-100 in fees for a round trip.
- **Relevance**: Shows that exchanges profit from trading volume, not trader success. More trades = more revenue, creating incentive to encourage frequent trading.

### Finding 2: Spread vs. Commission Models
- **Source**: Forbes and CoinDesk analysis
- **Fact**: Some exchanges (like eToro) use spread-based pricing instead of explicit fees. Spreads can be 1-3% on volatile assets, appearing "commission-free" but costing more than traditional fee models.
- **Relevance**: Explains the "true cost" of copy trading and zero-commission platforms

### Finding 3: Funding Rates on Perpetual Contracts
- **Source**: References from multiple sources
- **Fact**: Perpetual futures contracts (most popular leverage product) charge funding rates every 8 hours. During one-sided markets, rates can reach 0.1% per 8-hour period, equivalent to ~45% annually for continuously leveraged positions.
- **Relevance**: Hidden cost that compounds quickly for leverage traders. Even winning trades can be eroded by funding costs.

### Finding 4: Liquidation Mechanisms Generate Massive Profits
- **Source**: References from multiple sources
- **Fact**: During the May 2021 crash, over $10 billion in positions were liquidated in 24 hours. Exchanges profit from liquidation fees (0.5-1% of position size) plus the spread between liquidation price and actual execution.
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates that exchange incentives are misaligned with trader success - liquidations are profitable for the house

### Finding 5: The Volume Paradox
- **Source**: Forbes and CoinDesk studies
- **Fact**: Exchanges want users to trade MORE, not better. Higher frequency trading generates more fees even if traders lose money overall. Marketing focuses on "trading opportunities" rather than "hold and wait."
- **Relevance**: Explains why exchange education focuses on technical analysis and day trading rather than buy-and-hold strategies
